Assignments of Machine Learning for Image Processing ECE 285

## Assignment 1 (Backpropagation):

Created from scratch a simple machine learning technique to recognize hand-written digits from 0 to 9.
This assignment focuses on multiclass classification on the MNIST Dataset. Learnt to develop simple implementation for artificial neural networks and backpropagation algorithm. The MNIST Dataset consists of labeled images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. Each image is 28 by 28 pixels (784 pixels).

## Assignment 2 (CNNs and PyTorch):

Developed a deep learning technique and learnt how to use GPUs with PyTorch.
Classification on the MNIST Dataset using deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and PyTorch (instead of shallow ANNs and manual implementation).

## Assignment 3 (Transfer learning):

Teach a program how to recognize bird species when only a small dataset is available.
This assignment focuses on the best practices for managing a deep learning project and will use transfer learning for solving a classification problem. Learnt to use the PyTorchâ€™s DataLoader, and create checkpoints to stop and restart model training.

## Assignment 4 (Image Denoising):

Teach a program how to remove noise.
This assignment focuses on a specific regression problem: image  denoising. Used deep Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) with PyTorch and investigated DnCNN and U-net architectures.
